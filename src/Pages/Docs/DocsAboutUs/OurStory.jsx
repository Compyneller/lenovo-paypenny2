                The story starts with four friends living in Punjab, India. Two
                of them moved to Canada for further studies. While staying in
                foreign, they used to share their experiences with each other.
                To adjust the budget, two of the foreign friends started
                investing in crypto. And from there, the idea was generated.{" "}
                <br />
                <br />
                Together, they fourâ€” brainstormed, and invented the digital
                currency platform where BUYING & SELLING are exceptionally
                available at zero charges.
